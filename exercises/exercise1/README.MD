# üé® Exercise 1: Creating Mappings for Paintings and Painters

In this first exercise, you will learn how to design **schema mappings** that connect data about *paintings* and *painters* using CIDOC CRM Ontology.
The goal is to understand the basic concepts behind schema mapping and to become familiar with the **3M mapping editor** and the **X3ML language**.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Overview

The provided sample dataset consists of two files:

- paintings.xml: contains information about paintings 
- painters.xml: contains information about painters

--- 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Instructions

### Step1. Use 3M Editor

1. Visit 3M Editor (https://demos.isl.ics.forth.gr/3m/) and log in (if you already have an account) or register (if you do not have an account)

### Step2. Create a new schema mapping project

Create a new schema mapping project by including the provided XML datasets as source data. The indicative steps for doing so are: 

1. After logging in, click on **Add New**
2. Provide a short title and description of your project
3. Upload the provided XML datasets as source data
4. Select CIDOC CRM (v7.1.1) as a target schema
5. Use the basic generator policy (we will deal with more sophisticated generators later)
6. Click Finish (below you can see a summary of the information that are needed for creating the project in 3M Editor- you should have something similar)
