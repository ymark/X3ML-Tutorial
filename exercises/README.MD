# üß≠ Hands-on exercises

This repository accompanies the tutorial on X3ML framework, presented at [IJCKG 2025](https://ijckg2025.github.io/).
It contains a set of hands-on exercises designed to guide participants through the complete workflow of **schema mapping definition, data transformation, and RDF generation**

Through these exercises, participants will:

- Learn how to **design and apply schema mappings** using the **X3ML language**.  
- Use the **3M editor** to define correspondences between source data elements and ontology concepts.  
- Execute transformations with the **X3ML Engine** to produce RDF data aligned with a target ontology.  
- Explore methods for **validating and inspecting** the generated RDF outputs.  
- Experiment with **LLM-assisted mapping generation** to see how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can accelerate and simplify the mapping process.

Each exercise builds on the previous one, providing a gradual learning curve ‚Äî from basic mappings to more advanced, semantically rich transformations.
