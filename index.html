					<p>
						This tutorial introduces participants to the X3ML Framework, a suite of specifications and tools for 
						constructing knowledge graphs from structured data. 
						The tutorial will provide both conceptual foundations and hands-on demonstrations, guiding attendees through the workflow 
						of defining schema mappings and transforming source data into RDF aligned with domain ontologies. 
						At the core of the framework is a declarative, technology-agnostic mapping language that supports collaborative and maintainable 
						schema mapping practices. Participants will learn how X3ML facilitates not only the creation of semantic mappings but 
						also the exploration and verification of the resulting knowledge graphs to ensure correctness and completeness. 
						The session will further highlight domain-independent applications of X3ML across fields such as cultural heritage and biodiversity, 
						while also showcasing emerging methods that integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate and simplify schema mapping tasks.

					<h3 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Learning Objectives</h3>
					<p>
						By the end of this tutorial participants will be able to: 
						<ul>
							<li>understand the principles and challenges of transforming heterogenous source data into RDF knowledge graphs</li>
							<li>apply the X3ML mapping language and associated tools to design, implement and validate schema mappings</li>
							<li>gain hands-on experience in generating semantically rich knowledge graphs and verifying their quality</li>
							<li>explore innovative techniques leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce manual effort and enhance the schema
								mapping process</li>
						</ul>
						Equipped with this knowledge, participants will be able to effectively use X3ML framework in real-world scenarios to build 
						interoperable, semantically robust knowledge graphs across diverse application domains.

					<p>
						The tutorial will be held on <b>October 16, 2025</b> as part of the 
						<a href="https://ijckg2025.github.io/" target="_blank"><b>IJCKG 2025 conference</b></a>, and it will be structured to balance 
						conceptual understanding with practical application.
						It will begin with a slide-based presentation introducing the core concepts of knowledge graph construction and the X3ML framework.
						This will be followed by a live online demonstration, showcasing the workflow of schema mapping and RDF generation using the 
						framework tools and resources.
						Finally, participants will engage in guided hands-on exercises to practice defining schema mappings and transforming data collections themselves.
						The entire session will last one hour, ensuring an engaging and focused learning experience that combines theory, 
						demonstration and active participation within the conference program.

					<h3 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Audience</h3>
					<p>
						This tutorial is designed for researchers, practitioners, and developers interested in semantic technologies 
						and data integration for the construction of knowledge graphs. It will be particularly valuable for those 
						working with ontologies and knowledge graphs across domains such as cultural heritage, and other 
						data-intensive fields. 
						Participants are expected to have a basic understanding of ontologies and RDF, which will help them
						follow the conceptual discussions and fully benefit from the practical hands-on exercises. 
						No prior experience with the X3ML framework is required, as all necessary concepts and tools will be 
						introduced during the session.
